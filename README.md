# McM_Company
A highly popular ‘McM Sangeet company’ plans to organize a competition for
searching the right talents to train them for creating music albums. The company
advertises their recruitment requirements on different channels (both print and
digital media) for inviting talents by submitting their personal information, prior
experience, and a 2-5 minutes media file, which is of either an audio file (for
songs) or a video (for songs and/or playing music instruments), to a given URL in
the advertisement. The company writes in the advertisement that the shortlisted
candidate will be informed by Phone and/or Email.
 A candidate can submit more than one entry and has an option to provide more
than one phone number in the submission, which are unique to him/her.
 After the closing date of entry submission, a panel evaluates all entries and
recommends a set of candidates to invite them for the next round. The company
maintains the information about the panellist (personal information, industry
experience, association with the McM company). A candidate can see the
outcome of their application online.
 These shortlisted candidates are then invited to perform a ‘Live’ show in Mumbai
and finally top ‘n’ candidates are selected in each album category (i.e. audio and
video). These 2n candidates are called as the member of McM-2020.
 Different music groups (pop, classic, leisure, evergreen, ...) are formed to create
the music albums (audio/video). Every member belongs to one or more music
group which is moderated by a director who himself/herself is a member of the
group. Each member has a different role to play in each album.
 Once the album is created and approved by McM Director, its trailer is released
online for limited time to the outsiders to give their comments (like and dislike),
and all this recorded in the database (album name, date of release, number of
visits, number of likes/dislikes, ...).
 The McM decides the price of the album after analysing the data collected from
its trailer release, and then the album is released to distributors who eventually
will sell it online. Note, each distributor may be charged a different price per unit
depending on the negotiation between the McM and distributor.
 When a distributor sells an album, the download request comes to the McM site.
Thus, the McM company maintains the record for each download (Incoming URL
– identifying the distributor, Album#, Date, Download Status – success/failure) so
that they can track the number of downloads for raising the invoice.
